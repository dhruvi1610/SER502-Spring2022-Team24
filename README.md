# SER502-Team24

********************************Semester Project for SER 502 Spring 2022******************************************
Language Name : GJ
We are extremely delighted to come up with a language that has words similar to our language ‘Gujarati’. The keywords for this language are aligned to the traditional Gujarati language. We are experiencing that influence of western culture is increasing day by day in India, and people are leaning more towards languages that are internationally recognized, spoken and understood. We are in a hope that, one day this language will be more popular and people will want to learn Gujarati language to better understand a widely accepted programming language(GJ).
